# FinetunedBertforJobDescriptions

Used a transformers natural language processing model, DistilBert and finetuned it in a Jupyter Notebook using masked language modeling. Specifically used the Transformers and TensorFlow Libraries in Python. Decreased perplexlity measure from 25 to 11 making the model more familiar with text present in job description data. This finetuning was done for a further downstream classification of job descriptions as remote or in-person. This masked language modeling was done based on a sample of 150 million job description.
